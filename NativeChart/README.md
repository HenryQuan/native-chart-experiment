# Native Chart Experiment
Please use [react-native-charts-wrapper](https://github.com/wuxudong/react-native-charts-wrapper) whenever possible. This is only meant to use with my app, [WoWs Info](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Re).

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-native-chart --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-native-chart`

This is not needed for React Native 0.60+. **Please create a swift file inside your main IOS project in order to have a bridging header.**
