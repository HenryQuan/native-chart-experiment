# Native Chart Experiment
Please use [react-native-charts-wrapper](https://github.com/wuxudong/react-native-charts-wrapper) whenever possible. This is only meant to use with my app, [WoWs Info](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Re).

This is yet another module for WoWs Info. I moved to `React Native` two years ago in order to support Android and completely gave up native IOS. However, the `Charts` library is just too good and I want to bring it back to WoWs Info again. `react-native-charts-wrapper` is great but I couldn't use it properly. I have done some styling before so I can reuse my old native charts. However, I have been avoiding writing native ui modules but now, it is time to change and use more native ui modules, especially for IOS.
