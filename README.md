# Native Chart Experiment
Guess what? Yes, you are probably right. 

This is yet another module for [WoWs Info](https://github.com/HenryQuan/WoWs-Info-Re). I moved to `React Native` two years ago in order to support Android and completely gave up native IOS. However, the `Charts` library is just too good and I want to bring it back to WoWs Info again. `react-native-charts-wrapper` is great but I couldn't use it properly. I have done some styling before so I can reuse my old native charts. However, I have been avoiding writing native ui modules but now, it is time to change and use more native ui modules, especially for IOS. 

*More coming soon... (Android part)*
